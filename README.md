# Julia Bug: Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a missing return statement in a function with multiple conditional branches.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, where the function `myfunction` lacks a return statement for the case where the input `x` is 0. This leads to unpredictable results when calling the function with `x = 0`.

The `bugSolution.jl` file presents a corrected version of the function, ensuring a return statement for all possible input values.
